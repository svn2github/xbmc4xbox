 * Dec 15, 2009, John Cunningham
 * Added rewinddir member function
 *
 * Jan 18, 2008, Toni Ronkko
 * Using FindFirstFileA and WIN32_FIND_DATAA to avoid converting string
 * between multi-byte and unicode representations.  This makes the
 * code simpler and also allows the code to be compiled under MingW.  Thanks
 * to Azriel Fasten for the suggestion.
 *
 * Mar 4, 2007, Toni Ronkko
 * Bug fix: due to the strncpy_s() function this file only compiled in
 * Visual Studio 2005.  Using the new string functions only when the
 * compiler version allows.
 *
 * Nov  2, 2006, Toni Ronkko
 * Major update: removed support for Watcom C, MS-DOS and Turbo C to
 * simplify the file, updated the code to compile cleanly on Visual
 * Studio 2005 with both unicode and multi-byte character strings,
 * removed rewinddir() as it had a bug.
 *
 * Aug 20, 2006, Toni Ronkko
 * Removed all remarks about MSVC 1.0, which is antiqued now.  Simplified
 * comments by removing SGML tags.
 *
 * May 14 2002, Toni Ronkko
 * Embedded the function definitions directly to the header so that no
 * source modules need to be included in the Visual Studio project.  Removed
 * all the dependencies to other projects so that this very header can be
 * used independently.
 *
 * May 28 1998, Toni Ronkko
 * First version.

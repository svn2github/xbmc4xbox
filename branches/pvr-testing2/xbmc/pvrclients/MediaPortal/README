General description:

This is a PVR Add-on for XBMC to access/control the MediaPortal TV-Server
backend from XBMC. It consists of two plugins: one for XBMC-PVR (1) and one for
the MediaPortal TV Server (2).

1. PVR client "XBMC_MPTV_win32.pvr" (for Windows):
   This is the addon in this directory. After building the XBMC solution (and
   the "pvrclient_mptv") this plugin file should be in addons\pvr\MediaPortal\

The MediaPortal TV Server is written in C#, making it difficult for XBMC to
control it directly. The TV Server connection of this AddOn depends on a
special plugin at the TV Server side, called TVServerXBMC.


2. TV Server plugin TVServerXBMC.dll/.exe (Windows only):
   The TVServerXBMC plugin for the TV Server provides a socket interface to
   XBMC to control the TV Server.
   You can download it separately from:
   http://www.scintilla.utwente.nl/~marcelg/xbmc
   (It is not included by default in the XBMC pvr-testing2 branch, because it
   will introduce a dependency on Visual C#.)
   Please read the "readme.txt" file included in the TVServerXBMC zip files
   for more information.

----------------------------------------------
Detailed instructions:

(Preliminary...)

1. Install MediaPortal & MediaPortal TV Server (1.1.0 beta1 or daily build 01-08-2010)
   (for older versions, you will need to recompile the TVServerXBMC plugin from source)
2. Use MediaPortal to make sure that the TV Server is working fine
3. Download the TVServerXBMC plugin for the TV Server (see my website)
4. Run the TVServerXBMC.exe (standalone version of the TV Server plugin) and
   test it (see the readme.txt file included in the TVServerXBMC zip file).
   Test for example the commands "ListTVChannels", "TimeshiftChannel"
   (id is the first field returned by "ListTVChannels"). The "TimeshiftChannel"
   command should return a URL like "rtsp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx/stream2.0" on a
   successful timeshift start. You can test this URL in VLC player. This should
   work before proceeding to the next steps.
5. Test the rtsp stream in XBMC (just use the standard 9.11)
   Create a playlist file "rtsp-stream.m3u" with the rtsp:// URL as content and
   start it from inside XBMC.
   Example contents rtsp-stream.m3u:
-----
rtsp://192.168.2.5/steam2.0
-----
When this is all working fine, you can finally build XBMC-pvr-testing2:

6. Build the XBMC solution in VC Express (pvr-testing2)
  (check if XBMC_MPTV_win32.pvr was created succesfully in addons\pvr\MediaPortal)

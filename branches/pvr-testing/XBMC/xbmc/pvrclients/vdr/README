This is a PVR Add-on for XBMC to add VDR (http://www.cadsoft.de/vdr) as a TV/PVR Backend to
XBMC.

It want to support Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings, programming Timers and 
EPG TV Guide to use on same computer or over the Network.

The connection of this AddOn depend upon a installed Streamdev-Server-Plugin on the VDR.
This is the only minimum requirement to VDR for a connection to this addon, but the
functionality can be improved by some other types of VDR Plugins.

 This code is 100% free. Use it anywhere you want. Rewrite it, restructure it,
 whatever. If you can write software that makes money off of it, good for you.
 I kinda like capitalism. Please don't blame me if it causes your $30 billion
 dollar satellite explode in orbit. If you redistribute it in any form, I'd
 appreciate it if you would leave this notice here.

 There is only a disclaimer at http://cr.yp.to/ftpparse.html.
 Here's the disclaimer.
 .
 Commercial use of ftpparse is fine, as long as you let me know what programs
 you're using it in.
 .
 This is problematic as it does not explain or guarantee any of the open source
 freedom a user has such as freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the
 software. It also places an extra burden for commercial use of this software by
 requiring it's commercial use to be announced to the original maintainer,
 something incompatible with the GPL.
 .
 I suggest we change this to use code based off of wget.

License: libdumb
 This license is not compatible with the GPL and not open source because of
 sections 4, 5, and 6. XBMC should instead use libmikmod which is LGPL. Another
 alternative is to just use timidity which is already used by XBMC as timidity
 plays the same sound formats as libdumb, as well as other sound formats.

 This is a non-open source license incompatible with the GPL. Although the
 license allows it to be included in GPL or open source software, section 3
 has the excessive restriction that modifications must be contributed back,
 something in which is a violation of the terms of the GPL.
 .
 I suggest we use the implementation in libdemac or just ffmpeg instead.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
   The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
   some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
   various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
   FreeType Project.
 .
   This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
   which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
   affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
   documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
   This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
   (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
   and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
   alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
     o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
       interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
     o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
       full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
     o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
       it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
       somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
       FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
   We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
   software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
   We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
   assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 .
   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
   credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
   encourage you to use the following text:
 .
    """  
     Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
     Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
    """
 .
   Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
   actually use.
 .
 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
   Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
   and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
   distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
   Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
   beta or final release.
 .
   `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
   `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
   code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
   This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
   engine'.
 .
   This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
   FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
   documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
   original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
   If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
   this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
   The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
   Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
   specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 .
   THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
   WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
   BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
   USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
   This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
   irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
   display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
   sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
   forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
   authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
   herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
     o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
       (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
       the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
       documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
       original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
       files.
 .
     o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
       states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
       FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
       encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
       documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
   These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
   the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
   our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
   to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
   Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
   the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
   purposes without specific prior written permission.
 .
   We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
   following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
   or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
   `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
   As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
   accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
   material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
   authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
   Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
   Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
   of this license.
 .
 4. Contacts

 .
   There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

 LASTS, AND SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
 OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR
 EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL
 RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

 LEGAL ISSUES
 ============
 .
 In plain English:
 .
 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.
 .
 In legalese:
 .
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
 .
 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 .
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 .
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 .
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 .
 .
 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
 .
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
 code.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
     CompuServe Incorporated."

 This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
 In no event shall the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the
 use of this software.
 .
 Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
 including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
 freely, subject to the following restrictions:
 .
 1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim
    that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a
    product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product
    documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of
    this software, but this is not a strict requirement.
 .
    [Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.
    Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is "http://dumb.sf.net/".]
 .
    [The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two
    reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list of
    acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was placing
    a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using the GNU
    General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See
    http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html for more information on this
    subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do
    urge you to acknowledge its use.]
 .
 2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
    misrepresented as being the original software.
 .
 3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.
 .
 4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom on any Monday at
    3:05 pm, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This
    clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one
    clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]
 .
 5. Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are
    required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).
    [This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's
    clause was.]
 .
 6. No clause in this licence shall prevent this software from being depended
    upon by a product licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. If such a
    clause is deemed to exist, Debian, then it shall be respected in spirit as
    far as possible and all other clauses shall continue to apply in full
    force.
 .
 We regret that we cannot provide any warranty, not even the implied warranty
 of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
 .
 Some files generated or copied by automake, autoconf and friends are
 available in an extra download. These fall under separate licences but are
 all free to distribute. Please check their licences as necessary.

 libVorbis, libVorbisFile and DUMB libraries. These libraries come with
 additional requirements and restrictions that you must follow in order
 to legally use this software. Please read the COPYING files in the

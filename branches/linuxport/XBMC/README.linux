This is a very early port of XBMC to Linux. It's target is developers and not end-users. We don't offer end-user support yet, and we're not really interrested to hear about bugs unless you can help track it down and possibly help with fixing it.
The developers recommends Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) as a development platform.

Getting the source code
-----------------------
# sudo apt-get install subversion
# cd $HOME
# svn checkout https://xbmc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xbmc/branches/linuxport/XBMC

Installing the required ubuntu packages
---------------------------------------
# sudo apt-get install make g++-4.1 gcc-4.1 libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev libsdl-stretch-dev libcdio6 libcdio-dev libfribidi0 libfribidi-dev liblzo1 liblzo-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev libogg-dev libsmbclient-dev libsmbclient libasound2-dev python2.4-dev python2.4 python-sqlite libglew1 libglew-dev libcurl3-dev g++ gawk x11proto-xinerama-dev libxinerama-dev

How to compile
--------------
OpenGL 3D version (requires gfx-adapter that has supported OpenGL hw acceleration, set bitdepth to 24bpp or 32bpp)
# ./configure
# make

SDL 2D version (much much slower GUI rendering but works on all adapters and bitdepths)
# ./configure --disable-gl
# make

No debug information (smaller executable, no FreeMem text in screens):
# ./configure --disable-debug
# make

No debug information and 2D:
# ./configure --disable-debug --disable-gl
# make

Quicker compilation; by adding -j<number> to the make command, you describe how many cores will be used. So for dualcore the commands are:
# make -j2
or
# make -j2 sdl_2d

How to run
----------
A new script made by Althekiller handles things neatly now, this is the first basic version which does the following:
-Copies needed files & folders to a BUILD folder incl main executable
-Backs up UserData & scripts folder
-Fixes case sensitivity issues by renaming some files
-Circumvents a bug with skin fonts by copying it to media/Fonts
Usage:
# ./noT3CH.sh
cd BUILD
./XboxMediaCenter

Fullscreen
----------
Toggle FS with \ key while XBMC is running


Multi-monitor Fullscreen
------------------------
If you have a multi-monitor setup and you want to use '-fs', make sure to set the env variable 
SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD to the display no. which you want SDL to use for the fullscreen mode.

For e.g. "SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD=1 ./XboxMediaCenter -fs" to tell SDL to use display no.1

Channels downmix
----------------
if your machine only has 2 speakers and you would like to watch movies with more channels (e.g. 5.1) then you need to configure your .asoundrc file.
the .asoundrc file is a configuration file located in the users home directory.
a demo file can be found here "demo-asoundrc", so:
1. backup your .asoundrc if it exists (e.g. $cp ~/.asoundrc ~/.asoundrc.backup)
2. copy the demo asoundrc - $cp demo-asoundrc ~/.asoundrc
3. you can edit the file and change the downmix setup by changing the "ttable" values. the values range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are actaully the volume pct from the original channels volume. 

Don't expect too much, yet.

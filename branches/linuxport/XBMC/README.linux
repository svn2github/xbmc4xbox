This is an initial port of the skinning tool to Linux. Later on it will include 
the remaining XBMC functionality. 

I have tested this to work with Ubuntu.

Getting the source code
-----------------------
# sudo apt-get install subversion
# cd $HOME
# svn checkout https://xbmc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xbmc/branches/linuxport/XBMC

Installing the required ubuntu packages
---------------------------------------
# sudo apt-get install make g++-4.1 gcc-4.1 libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev libsdl-stretch-dev libcdio6 libcdio-dev libfribidi0 libfribidi-dev liblzo1 liblzo-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev libogg-dev libsmbclient-dev libsmbclient libasound2-dev python2.4-dev python2.4 python-sqlite libglew1 libglew-dev libcurl3-dev

How to compile
--------------
OpenGL 3D version (requires gfx-adapter that has supported OpenGL hw acceleration, set bitdepth to 24bpp or 32bpp)
# cd $HOME/XBMC
# make

SDL 2D version (much much slower GUI rendering but works on all adapters and bitdepths)
# cd $HOME/XBMC
# make sdl_2d

Quicker compilation; by adding -j<number> to the make command, you describe how many cores will be used. So for dualcore the commands are:
# make -j2
or
# make -j2 sdl_2d

How to run
----------
1. Take the T3CH Xbox distribution and extract it to your home directory. 
2. Set XBMC_HOME to where T3CH was extracted: 
   # export XBMC_HOME=/home/whatever/XBMC
2. Copy the XboxMediaCenter file that was generated by make and copy it
   to the same directory as default.xbe (T3CH folder).
3. Copy the .so files under $HOME/XBMC/system to their respective directories 
   in the T3CH/system folder.
5. mv $XBMC_HOME/media/Fonts/arial.ttf $XBMC_HOME/media/Fonts/Arial.ttf
6. ln -s $XBMC_HOME/scripts $XBMC_HOME/Scripts
7. Change directory to where you copied the exceutable and type
   # ./XboxMediaCenter

Fullscreen
----------
To launch XBMC in fullscreen mode append the '-fs' option to the command line while launching.


Multi-monitor Fullscreen
------------------------
If you have a multi-monitor setup and you want to use '-fs', make sure to set the env variable 
SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD to the display no. which you want SDL to use for the fullscreen mode.

For e.g. "SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD=1 ./XboxMediaCenter -fs" to tell SDL to use display no.1

Don't expect too much, yet.

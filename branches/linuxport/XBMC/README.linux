1. Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very early port of XBMC to Linux. It's target is developers
and not end-users. We don't offer end-user support yet, and we're not
really interrested to hear about bugs unless you can help track it
down and possibly help with fixing it. We currently recommend Ubuntu
7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) as a development platform. A gfx-adapter with
OpenGL acceleration is highly recommended and 24/32 bitdepth is
required with OpenGL.

NOTE TO NEW LINUX USERS: All lines that are prefixed with the '#'
character are commands that need to be typed into a terminal window /
console (similar to the command prompt for Windows). Note that the '#'
character itself should NOT be typed as part of the command.

4. How to compile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
4.1 Using build.sh
----------------------------------------

AlTheKiller has made a fantastic script that makes it a breeze to
build a working (depending on state of SVN naturally) XBMC solution.
It handles the SVN update, build process and the copying of all needed
files to the folder of your choice.  ./BUILD is the default target
location. The script also creates a backup of your UserData, scripts
and 3rd party skin/s folders.  Do './build.sh --help' to get all
options.  

Usage (examples):

.1 Make a 3D version with debug (requires OpenGL hardware acceleration
   support on gfx-adapter)
   # ./build.sh

.2 Make a SDL 2D version (very slow) + no debug (more CONFIGOPT's are
   listed below in section 4.2)
   # ./build.sh CONFIGOPT=--disable-gl CONFIGOPT=--disable-debug

build.sh supports reading options from an external file:
'~/.xbmc-build-settings'.  The options are delimited with space,
here's an example line which disables debug and never ask for
confirmation unless an error occur: 'CONFIGOPT=--disable-debug
CONFIRM'(remove the ''). Do build.sh --help for more options

----------------------------------------
4.2 Manual build
----------------------------------------

To create the XBMC executable manually perform these two steps:

.1  # ./configure <option1> <option2> <etc>

These configure options exist:
  --disable-debug          disable debug mode (default is enabled)
  --disable-gl             disable OpenGL rendering and instead use 2D SDL (default is enabled). This is not recommended.
  --enable-profiling       enable gprof profiling (default is disabled)
  --disable-joystick       disable SDL joystick support (default is enabled)
  --help                   shows all options, useful fallback if this README becomes outdated

.2  # make

Tip: by adding -j<number> to the make command, you describe how many
     concurrent jobs will be used. So for dualcore the command is: 

    # make -j2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How to run
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
5.1 build.sh
----------------------------------------
If using build.sh with default options, simply:
   # cd BUILD
   # ./XboxMediaCenter

----------------------------------------
5.2 Manual
----------------------------------------
If compiling manually you can use build.sh to prepare the BUILD
What it does:
* Copies needed files & folders to a BUILD folder incl. main executable
* Backs up UserData, scripts and 3rd party skin/s folders
* Fixes case sensitivity issues by renaming some files & folders
Usage:
   # ./build.sh NOUPDATE NOCOMPILE
   # cd BUILD
   # ./XboxMediaCenter


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Tips n' Tricks section
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
6.1 Fullscreen
----------------------------------------

The best way is to go into settings\Appearance\Screen and set Resolution 
to the one with (Desktop) next to it.  Toggle FS with the \ key while XBMC
is running. To start XBMC in fullscreen mode append a '-fs' to the command
line. 

----------------------------------------
6.2 Multi-monitor Fullscreen
----------------------------------------

If you have a multi-monitor setup and you want to run XBMC fullscreen
only on one monitor, then make sure to set the environment variable
SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD to the display no.  which you want to use.

For e.g. "SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD=1 ./XboxMediaCenter" to tell XBMC 
to use display no.1.

Note: Nvidia Twinview users should be aware that X treats the
twinviewed displays as the same head.  If you want to run fullscreen
XBMC on one display and start it from the other you must configure X
with two "Device" sections against the same physical card. See chapter
16 of the Nvidia user guide for information on how to do this.

----------------------------------------
6.3 Channel downmixing
----------------------------------------

(This is Not required Anymore since revision 10937) 
If your machine only has 2 speakers and you would like to watch movies
with more channels (e.g. 5.1) then you need to configure your
.asoundrc file. The .asoundrc file is a configuration file located in
the user's home directory. A sample configuration named "demo-asoundrc"
can be found in same folder as this README, so:


.1 backup your .asoundrc if it exists (e.g. # cp ~/.asoundrc ~/.asoundrc.backup)

.2 copy the demo asoundrc - # cp demo-asoundrc ~/.asoundrc

.3 you can edit the file and change the downmix setup by changing the
   "ttable" values. The values range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are actaully the
   volume pct from the original channels volume.

----------------------------------------
6.4 Fullscreen Mouse Sensitivity
----------------------------------------

If you find that your mouse is not sensitive enough in fullscreen, set
the environment variable SDL_VIDEO_X11_MOUSEACCEL to adjust mouse
acceleration. From SDL docs:

  "For X11, SDL_VIDEO_X11_MOUSEACCEL sets the mouse acceleration. The
  value should be a string on the form: n/d/t where n and d are the
  acceleration numerator/denumerators (so mouse movement is
  accelerated by n/d), and t is the threshold above which acceleration
  applies (counted as number of pixels the mouse moves at once)."

----------------------------------------
6.5 Turning off on screen debug info
----------------------------------------

The proper way is to compile with the --disable-debug option this will 
make a smaller executeable as well.
Add -q to the commandline "./XboxMediaCenter -q" will remove the on screen
Debug info when you have compiled with debug mode on (default)

----------------------------------------
6.6 Get DVD/CD Share to show Correct State
----------------------------------------

To get the DVD Tray shortcut to not display (Open) all the time you
need to install a newer verison of libcdio

  Installing latest libcdio 
  Download version 0.78 from  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libcdio/libcdio-0.78.2.tar.gz
  Extract and run in libcdio path # ./configure --prefix=/usr 
  make ; # sudo make install 
  Recompile xbmc after make clean and ./configure
  SVN 10557+ will print the libcdio version it has been compiled with to stdout (first line). 

----------------------------------------
6.7 Basic MythTV support
----------------------------------------

  We have very basic MythTV support in xbmc. enable using --enable-gmyth on configure line. 
  requires glib-2.0, gobject-2.0, gthread-2.0, curl, gmyth.

  You have to manually add a share like "myth://user:pass@hostname/" since there is no support
  for browsing for server at the moment.

  Know Issues:
    * Channel Switching in dvdplayer using Page Up/Down fails
    * Seeking in live-recorded streams doesn't work properly
    * Current playback position doesn't update properly when program changes

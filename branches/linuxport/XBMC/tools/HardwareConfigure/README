The HardwareConfigure is meant to look up known LIRC devices and copy the needed configure files for it. It will need root privelieges and it is only meant to be run at startup, no hotplugging.

to compile it:
./build.sh

to run it:
./HardwareConfigure PathToLIRC
PathToLIRC in ubuntu is /etc/lirc/

How to expand it:
Add the udi tag in AvailableRemotes along with a FriendlyName, FriendlyName udi (ie mceusb2 would be: mceusb2 /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/usb_device_471_815_PH00Dwgw_if0), these can be found in ie gnome-device-manager.
Add friendlyname.hardware.conf and friendlyname.lircd.conf in the folder of HardwareConfigure and it will copy it if it finds the Hardware.

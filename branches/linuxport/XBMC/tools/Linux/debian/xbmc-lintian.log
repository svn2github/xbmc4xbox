N: 
N:    When scripts are installed into a directory in the system PATH, the
N:    script name should not include an extension such as .sh or .pl that
N:    denotes the scripting language currently used to implement it. The
N:    implementation language may change; if it does, leaving the name the
N:    same would be confusing and changing it would be disruptive.

N: 
N:    The copyright file for this package does not appear to contain a
N:    copyright notice. You should copy the copyright notice from the upstream
N:    source (or add one of your own for a native package). A copyright notice
N:    must consist of Copyright, Copr., or the Unicode symbol of C in a circle
N:    followed by the years and the copyright holder. A copyright notice is
N:    not required for a work to be copyrighted, but Debian requires the
N:    copyright file include the authors and years of copyright, and including
N:    a valid copyright notice is the best way to do that.
N:    
N:    If the package is in the public domain rather than copyrighted, be sure
N:    to mention "public domain" in the copyright file. Please be aware that
N:    this is very rare and not the same as a DFSG-free license. True public
N:    domain software is generally limited to such special cases as a work
N:    product of a United States government agency.

         * However, if the timing is just right (i.e. wrong) then we lose focus to the window-list, see that it's
         * another TOPMOST window, at which time focus leaves the window-list and goes to the selected window
         * and then make ourselves NOTOPMOST and so raise ourselves above it.
         * We could just go straight to the bottom of the z-order but that'll mean we disappear as soon as the
         * window-list appears.
         * So, the best I can come up with is to go NOTOPMOST asap and then if hNewFore is NOTOPMOST go below that,

Platinum 0.3.6
---------------
- fixed list of devices not being cleared when ctrl point is stopped
- fixed setting bad content length when serving a file with a byte-range request causing
- filemediaserver now exposes one resource per network interface and put the proper one first (one the browse request was received on)
- start listening for ssdp when upnp starts and stops when it stops
- reversing back adding the Search method to ContentDirectory service
- rewrite of action processing after finding a major flaw due to parallel processing of multiple calls to the same action. Now each invocation of an action gets its own sets of arguments (in and out).

- Tasks and TaskManager rewrote. No more housekeeping thread to cleanup tasks. Tasks are automatically cleaned up when done.
- Stopping a ControlPoint will also stop the SSDP search tasks.
- HttpServer can limit the number of connections (threads) it can handle at once.
- Didl processing rewrote. Didl objects are more C++ oriented now.
- Some progress in regards to DLNA validation. HTTP Server is 1.0 only (connections are closed immediately once all data has been sent. No more keep-alive support).

---------------
Fixes/Changes:
- Fixed LightSample Test

Platinum 0.3.00 
---------------
Fixes/Changes:
- Added MacOSX support.
- Fixed socket abortion problem on Linux (using a pipe).
- Complete rewrite to use threads instead of interrupt driven round-robin. The benefit is that throughput is now greatly improved (for streaming especially).

- Added README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE files

Known issues:

- Http server does not use a thread pool. This can be a problem with hungry ControlPoints like the Intel Tools AV MediaController.

       [The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two
       reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list
       of acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was
       placing a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using
       the GNU General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See
       http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html for more information on this
       subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do
       urge you to acknowledge its use.]

    2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
       misrepresented as being the original software.

    3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source
       distribution.

    4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom on any Monday at
       3:05 pm, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This
       clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one
       clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]

    5. Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are
       required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).
       [This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's
       clause was.]

    6. No clause in this licence shall prevent this software from being depended
       upon by a product licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. If such
       a clause is deemed to exist, Debian, then it shall be respected in spirit
       as far as possible and all other clauses shall continue to apply in full
       force.

    We regret that we cannot provide any warranty, not even the implied warranty
    of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

    Some files generated or copied by automake, autoconf and friends are
    available in an extra download. These fall under separate licences but are
    all free to distribute. Please check their licences as necessary.

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts

PURPOSE.

The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Original Code
(including any Modifications You make) and the Documentation is with
You. Should the Original Code or the Documentation prove defective,
You (and not GoAhead or its distributors, licensors or dealers) assume
the entire cost of all necessary servicing or repair. GoAhead does not
warrant that the functions contained in the Original Code will meet your
requirements or operate in the combination that You may select for use,
that the operation of the Original Code will be uninterrupted or error
free, or that defects in the Original Code will be corrected. No oral
or written statement by GoAhead or by a representative of GoAhead shall
create a warranty or increase the scope of this warranty.

GOAHEAD DOES NOT WARRANT THE ORIGINAL CODE AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OR THE
LIKE WITH RESPECT TO ANY COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK
OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND DOES NOT WARRANT
THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY VIRUS, SOFTWARE ROUTINE

YOUR SOLE REMEDIES AND GOAHEAD'S ENTIRE LIABILITY ARE SET FORTH ABOVE. IN
NO EVENT WILL GOAHEAD OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS OR DEALERS BE LIABLE FOR

THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE, THE INABILITY TO USE THE ORIGINAL CODE,
OR ANY DEFECT IN THE ORIGINAL CODE, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF
THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

You agree that GoAhead and its distributors and dealers will not be
LIABLE for defense or indemnity with respect to any claim against You
by any third party arising from your possession or use of the Original
Code or the Documentation.

In no event will GoAhead�s total liability to You for all damages, losses,
and causes of action (whether in contract, tort, including negligence,
or otherwise) exceed the amount You paid for this product.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY
LASTS, AND SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR
EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL
RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

7. Indemnification by You.

You agree to indemnify and hold GoAhead harmless against any and all
claims, losses, damages and costs (including legal expenses and reasonable
counsel fees) arising out of any claim of a third party with respect to
the contents of the Your products, and any intellectual property rights
or other rights or interests related thereto.

8. High Risk Activities.

The Original Code is not fault-tolerant and is not designed , manufactured
or intended for use or resale as online control equipment in hazardous
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems,
air traffic control, direct life support machines or weapons systems,
in which the failure of the Original Code could lead directly to death,
personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.  GoAhead and
its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of
fitness for any high risk uses listed above.

9. Government Restricted Rights.

For units of the Department of Defense, use, duplication, or disclosure
by the Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph
(c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause
at DFARS 252.227-7013. Contractor/manufacturer is GoAhead Software,
Inc., 10900 N.E. 8th Street, Suite 750, Bellevue, Washington 98004.

If the Commercial Computer Software Restricted rights clause at FAR
52.227-19 or its successors apply, the Software and Documentation
constitute restricted computer software as defined in that clause and
the Government shall not have the license for published software set
forth in subparagraph (c)(3) of that clause.

The Original Code (i) was developed at private expense, and no part of it
was developed with governmental funds; (ii) is a trade secret of GoAhead
(or its licensor(s)) for all purposes of the Freedom of Information Act;
(iii) is "restricted computer software" subject to limited utilization as
provided in the contract between the vendor and the governmental entity;
and (iv) in all respects is proprietary data belonging solely to GoAhead
(or its licensor(s)).

10. Governing Law and Interpretation.

This Agreement shall be interpreted under and governed by the laws of the
State of Washington, without regard to its rules governing the conflict of
laws. If any provision of this Agreement is held illegal or unenforceable
by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions
of this Agreement shall remain in effect and the invalid provision deemed
modified to the least degree necessary to remedy such invalidity.

11. Entire Agreement.

This Agreement is the complete agreement between GoAhead and You and
supersedes all prior agreements, oral or written, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

License: PSF License for Python 2.4

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

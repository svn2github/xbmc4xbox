W: xbmc source: patch-system-but-direct-changes-in-diff Makefile and 50 more
N: 
N:    The package uses a patch system, but the Debian diff.gz contains changes
N:    to files or creation of additional files outside of the debian
N:    directory. This often indicates accidental changes that weren't meant to
N:    be in the package or changes that were supposed to be separated out into
N:    a patch. The package will also more easily support possible future
N:    source package formats if all changes outside the debian directory are
N:    stored as patches.

W: xbmc source: configure-generated-file-in-source config.log
N: 
N:    Leaving config.cache/status causes autobuilders problems. config.cache
N:    and config.status are produced by GNU autoconf's configure scripts. If
N:    they are left in the source package, autobuilders may pick up settings
N:    for the wrong architecture.
N:    
N:    The clean rule in debian/rules should remove this file. This should
N:    ideally be done by fixing the upstream build system to do it when you
N:    run the appropriate cleaning command (and don't forget to forward the
N:    fix to the upstream authors so it doesn't happen in the next release).
N:    If that is already implemented, then make sure you are indeed cleaning
N:    it in the clean rule. If all else fails, a simple rm -f should work.
N:    
N:    Note that Lintian cannot reliably detect the removal in the clean rule,
N:    so once you fix this, please ignore or override this warning.

N: 
N:    The referenced file seems to be from a libtool version older than
N:    1.5.2-2. This might lead to build errors on some newer architectures not
N:    known to this libtool.
N:    
N:    Please ask your upstream maintainer to re-libtoolize the package or do
N:    it yourself in case there is no active upstream anymore. Beware that
N:    might mean you need to update autoconf, too, if you use a very old
N:    version there as well.
N:    
N:    If you have not updated the file but fixed architecture-specific issues
N:    with minimal patches and verified that it builds correctly please
N:    override this tag. lintian will not be able to verify that.

N: 
N:    Each binary in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /sbin or /usr/games should
N:    have a manual page
N:    
N:    Note that though the man program has the capability to check for several
N:    program names in the NAMES section, each of these programs should have
N:    its own manual page (a symbolic link to the appropriate manual page is
N:    sufficient) because other manual page viewers such as xman or tkman
N:    don't support this.
N:    
N:    If the name of the man page differs from the binary by case, man may be
N:    able to find it anyway; however, it is still best practice to make the
N:    case of the man page match the case of the binary.
N:    
N:    If the man pages are provided by another package on which this package
N:    depends, lintian may not be able to determine that man pages are
N:    available. In this case, after confirming that all binaries do have man
N:    pages after this package and its dependencies are installed, please add
N:    a lintian override.

N: 
N:    The copyright file for this package does not appear to contain a

N:    source (or add one of your own for a native package). A copyright notice
N:    must consist of Copyright, Copr., or the Unicode symbol of C in a circle
N:    followed by the years and the copyright holder. A copyright notice is
N:    not required for a work to be copyrighted, but Debian requires the
N:    copyright file include the authors and years of copyright, and including
N:    a valid copyright notice is the best way to do that.
N:    
N:    If the package is in the public domain rather than copyrighted, be sure
N:    to mention "public domain" in the copyright file. Please be aware that
N:    this is very rare and not the same as a DFSG-free license. True public
N:    domain software is generally limited to such special cases as a work
N:    product of a United States government agency.

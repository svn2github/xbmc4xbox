Now fonts are distributed as a separate package - I don't have 
too many space on my www-server ;-))

So you need to download something like
http://xray.sai.msu.ru/~karpov/links-hacked/downloads/links-fonts-default.tgz
untar it to Links source dir - font/ subdir will appear
or copy this dir from your regular Links2 distro (graphics/font).

Of course, you may create it yourself - now we have simple rasterizer
for unicode ttf fonts - see utils/rasterizer.c

Then:

make distclean
autoheader
autoconf
automake
./configure
make

and so on, and so forth.

You may configure default font families either by hacking the source, or
by changing it through new (still very experimental) options system -
just press Ctrl+o and change all that you want ;-)

Happy hacking,

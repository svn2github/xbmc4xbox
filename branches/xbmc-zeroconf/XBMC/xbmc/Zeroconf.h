/// this class provides support for zeroconf
/// while the different zeroconf implementations have asynchronous APIs
/// this class hides it and provides only few ways to interact
/// with the services. If more control is needed, feel
/// free to add it. The main purpose currently is to provide an easy
/// way to publish services in the different StartXXX/StopXXX methods
/// in CApplication
///
/// One thing to think about is where to "standardize" the names, so that other
/// apps can parse the published services. e.g. the webserver should be published as
/// XBMC@$(HOSTNAME) with type "_http._tcp" so that e.g. the XBMC iPhone remote can use
/// that to display XBMC instances on the local network

<h2>General Information</h2>

<span class="bodyText">
<p>The yaSSL software package is a fast, open source, dual licensed implementation of SSL (SSLv3 and TLSv1).  It includes SSL client libraries and an SSL server implementation.  yaSSL supports multiple API's, including those defined by SSL and TLS.  yaSSL also supports an OpenSSL compatibility interface.  

<p>Since yaSSL is dual licensed, it is available under the GNU General Public License <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/">GPL</a>, as well as typical commercial terms and conditions.  If you have questions about licensing yaSSL, contact info(at)yassl.com.  

<p>yaSSL is currently available for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and MAC OS X.  Our goal is to port yaSSL to many operating environments, including real-time and embedded.  If you have an interest in testing yaSSL on another environment, let us know and we'll be happy to work with you to make a compiled version available.

<p>yaSSL currently supports the 'C' language as its primary interface.  We are intent on supporting yaSSL in several other languages, including Java, PHP, Perl, Python, Eiffel, etc.  If you have interest in using yaSSL in another programming language we do not currently support, then please contact us.

<p>If you are generally interested in security software, and have an interest in hacking at yaSSL, then we'd love your input on how we can improve our code base.

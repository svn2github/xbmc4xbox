Known Issues for 8.10 'Atlantis' Release of XBMC for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
*) There is no offloading of Video Decoding (commonly referred to as
 Hardware Acceleration) in XBMC at this time. This means that it takes
 powerful hardware to decode High Definition H.264 videos.
 
*) PulseAudio (Ubuntu component) causes various audio related problems
 for XBMC, so you might want to disable this component to be on the
 safe side.
 
*) 'Settings -> Videos -> Player -> High Quality Software Upscaling'
 is not recommended for use with older IGP solutions/slow hardware.
 Safest is to not enable it at all unless you are fully aware of what
 you're doing.
 
*) Intel GMA X3100 (GM965) and slower/older IGP's have issues handling
 1080p Display Output under Linux.
 
*) Some H.264 encoded videos experiences blocking. It's currently
 believed this is related to the unapproved FFMpeg 'Cabac patch' we
 use to speedup (multithread) H.264 decoding.
 
*) A running screensaver behind XBMC on Linux, running fullscreen, can
 cause graphical glitches.
 
*) Compiz / Desktop Effects and XBMC do not mix well, atleast not
 without serious tweaking to Compiz.
 
*) Event clients are not to be considered stable in this release.
 
*) Shoutcast/AAC streaming do not work correctly, it may re-buffer
 every 30 or so seconds.
 
*) Not all of XBMC's settings are active or do what they are supposed
 to.
 
*) "Rar sets" needs to be completely downloaded before XBMC can stream
 content from them.
 
*) Not all the old XBox XBMC scripts work with Linux/OS X/Win
 ports. Some don't even work on XBox anymore.
 
*) XBMC crashing on Linux will sometimes lock the mousepointer. To fix
 this, restart XBMC and quit it again to release it.
 
*) Visualisations are less polished than other components and may
 cause various glitches, like resizing issues.

Platinum is copyrighted free software by Sylvain Rebaud <sylvain@plutinosoft.com>.

Platinum uses a "dual licensing" business model. Under this model, users may choose to use Platinum under the free software/open source GNU General Public License (commonly known as the "GPL") or under a commercial license.

With the GPL license, Platinum is available free of charge. Users may download the software for free and modify, integrate and distribute it. However, GPL users must abide by the rules of the GPL, which stipulate that if a Platinum-based application is redistributed, the complete source code for this application must also be open and available for redistribution.

Plutinosoft offers a commercial license for organizations that do not want to release the source code for their application. Commercial license customers get a commercially supported product with a level of assurance from Plutinosoft, without the requirement that their Platinum-based software must be "open sourced". Plutinosoft is able to provide a commercial license because it has full ownership of the Platinum code.

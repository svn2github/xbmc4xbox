Run update.ffmpeg.sh to get the latest version from SVN.

Latest svn should be tagged as ffmpeg-xxx_libswscale-yyy where xxx and yyy
represent the version number of ffmpeg and libswscale respectively.  svn should
output these numbers.

Read README.svn_load_dirs to figure out how to first merge into the vendor
branch and then into our working copy.

************************************************************************************************************* 
*************************************************************************************************************

added/fixed: (dd-mm-yyyy) (please specify date in CET)
  - 08-06-2005 updated: fixed two linking errors so that mplayer.dll can be compiled without the last of libavcodecs encoders. (also demands dumping libavformat)
                        you can save almost 1 meg of memory if these changes are done. remove the libavformat dir and after having run configurexbmc add a line with
                        #undef CONFIG_ENCODERS to the end of config.h
  - 08-06-2005 updated: system headers to use with mingw 3.4.4 (USE GCC 3.4.4 OR HIGHER 3.4.x SERIES FROM NOW)
  - 08-06-2005 removed: unneeded video/audio filters
  - 08-06-2005 moved: xbmc hookup for audio into ao_directx instead of win32
  - 05-06-2005 fixed: player was resetting audio on each seak during ff/rw.. caused slowdowns
